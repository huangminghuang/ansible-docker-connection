# Docker connection plugin for Ansible (obsolete)

## Fork Note:

This is a fork of the original Docker connection plugin (https://github.com/lorin/ansible-docker-connection) for Ansible 1.9.x. Although there is an official Docker connection plugin now, it's still in the development branch as of September 2015. If you want to use the Ansible stable version, this plugin is your best shot.

## Note: Ansible now ships with a Docker connection plugin

There is now an [official Docker connection plugin](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/11650). Please use that code instead of the one in this repo, which is obsolete.




This repo contains a connection plugin for Ansible that lets you configure
Docker containers without needing to install an SSH server or Ansible itself
into the container.

This is a work-in-progress.

Requires Docker 1.3.1. On Linux, you could probably get away with 1.3.0, but
On OS X, you'll need Docker 1.3.1 and boot2docker 1.3.1.


## Known limitations

* can't explicitly configure docker connection parameters
* when using boot2docker, TLS must be disabled (see *boot2docker issues*)
* sudo isn't supported
* su isn't supported

## How to install

1. Create a `connection_plugins` directory next to your playbooks.
2. Copy the `connection_plugins/docker.py` file to the directory.

### ansible.cfg (remote temp)

You may also need to modify the remote temporary directory (I had to do this
with the `ubuntu` base image). Add the following to your ansible.cfg:

```
[defaults]
remote_tmp = /tmp
```


### boot2docker issues

Because of a [docker
issue](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/864://github.com/docker/docker/issues/8642),
if you are using boot2docker, you must disable TLS or the connection plugin will
hang.

To disable TLS in boot2docker:

```
boot2docker ssh
sudo -i
/etc/init.d/docker stop
echo DOCKER_TLS="no" > /var/lib/boot2docker/profile
/etc/init.d/docker start
```

Your `DOCKER_HOST` should now point to port 2376 (the IP may not match the one
below), and the `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY` and `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` environment variables
should not be deifned.

```
export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.59.103:2375
unset DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY
unset DOCKER_CERT_PATH
```

## How to use it

In your plays, add `connection: docker`. For example:

```
- name: configure my container
  connection: docker
  hosts: webcontainer

  tasks:
    - ...
```

You need a running container first, and you'll need to add the hostname to
Ansible's inventory. One way to do it is to write an initial play that runs a
container using the `docker` module and then uses the `add_host` module to add
to the inventory, like this:

```
- name: start up a docker container
  hosts: localhost
  vars:
    base_image: ubuntu
    docker_hostname: webcontainer

  tasks:
    - name: start up a docker container by running bash
      local_action: docker image={{ base_image }} name={{ docker_hostname }} detach=yes tty=yes command=bash
    - name: add the host
      add_host: name={{ docker_hostname }}

- name: configure the web container
  hosts: webcontainer
  connection: docker
  tasks:
   - ...
```

## Example: ipython notebook

Check out the [ipython.yml](ipython.yml) playbook for an example that builds a
container that runs an IPython notebook.

To build the example image, just do:

```
ansible-playbook ipython.yml
```

It will build a docker image called `lorin/ipython`

### Start the IPython notebook

This will start the notebook and mount /notebooks to your current directory on
the host.

```
docker run -d -p 8888:8888 -v `pwd`:/notebooks lorin/ipython
```

### Access the notebook

If you're running docker locally on Linux, browse to <http://localhost:8888>.

If you're using boot2docker, browse to the IP address associated with the
`DOCKER_HOST` environment variable, e.g.: <http://192.168.59.104:8888>

## FAQ

Q: Does it work with boot2docker?

A: It does, but you need to disable TLS. See above.

Q: What's with the `pre_image` and `final_image` in the
[ipython.yml](ipython.yml) playbook?

A: The playbook creates the pre-image by starting a container from a base
ubuntu image, configuring it with ansible, and then committing it. The playbook
creates the final image from the pre-image using a Dockerfile to set things like
the working directory, exposed ports, and command to run.

If you know how to do this one step, please let me know.

Q: Why does this repo contain custom [docker](library/docker) and [docker_image](library/docker_image) modules?

A: The upstream modules don't have support for boot2docker yet. I've submitted a
[pull request](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core/pull/272) to get
these added.
